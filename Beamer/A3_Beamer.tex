\section{Solution}
\begin{frame}{Solution}

    If A and B are mutually exclusive events then $\pr{EF}=0$\\
    As given in the question ;
    $$\pr{\bar E+\bar F}=0.25 $$
    As , $$\pr{\bar E+\bar F}=\pr{\overline{( E F)}}$$\\
    
    \begin{align}
        &\implies \pr{\overline{E F}}=0.25\\
        &\implies 1-\pr{EF}=0.25\\
        &\implies \pr{EF}=0.75
    \end{align}
    
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}
    $$\because \pr{EF}\neq 0$$
    $\therefore$ E and F are not mutually exclusive events.
